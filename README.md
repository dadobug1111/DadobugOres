# dadobugores-architectury-1.19
Both Forge and Fabric!

This mod adds Quasi-unbreakable bedrock ores.

They drop resources when you mine them, but do not actually disappear. The same effect applies when blown up by TNT/creepers/etc.

They require netherite tools or tnt to get resources, otherwise the ore cannot be mined.

**NEW:**now includes fluid ores. Just right click with a bucket, acts like an infinite source of the ore's fluid! Modded fluids, when added, may be given a limiter.
